Travis CI
Travis is a really useful continuous integration tool that lets us automate some of the tests and checks on our project every time we push it to Github.
  For example every time we push a change to github we can make it run our Python unit tests and our Python linting so if there is any issues with our code we can see straight away via an email notification that the build is broken.
steps
  sign up with github
  find repository
  check box to enable travis ci on it

The Travis CI configuration file is the file that tells Travis what to do every time we push a change to our project.
.travis.yml
